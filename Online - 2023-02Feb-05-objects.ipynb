    "\n",
    "Back in the 1970s, the software industry had a problem: People were writing code, and they were having trouble organizing it and maintaining it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Xerox established a research center called PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), where they got a bunch of very smart people to invent new technologies. They invented, among other things, the mouse, on-screen fonts and windows, the mouse, Ethernet, PostScript (the father of PDF), and a lot of other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the people at PARC was named Alan Kay. He saw the crisis in software as a problem worth solving. He decided to sovle it using something he called \"object-oriented programming,\" in a language called SmallTalk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kay thought about how we can structure our software, even if it's hugely complex. He took biological systems as the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our body, we have cells. Each cell is of a different type. Each type of cell can send certain kinds of messages, and can receive certain kinds of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "That model for software design is what led to object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We'll have different types of objects in our software\n",
    "- Each object will be able to send certain messages, and receive certain messages\n",
    "- By thinking in terms of these different types, we aren't overwhelmed by all of the implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects became super duper popular. Nowadays, it's a rare programming language that wants to be taken seriously which doesn't have objects.  Exceptions: Go, Erlang, bash.  But most languages do have object facilities, and use similar vocabulary to describe what we're doing, and how we're doing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a problem, and want to solve it with objects, you think about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What types of nouns are going to exist in this system?\n",
    "- What types of messages should those nouns be able to receive?\n",
    "- What types of messages should these nouns send to other objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create different types of objects, aka \"classes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object we create is an \"instance\" of a different type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each message we send is actually what we call \"invoking a method\" or \"calling a method.\""

    "Some languages (e.g., Java and C#) require that you do everything via classes and methods and objects.\n",
    "\n",

When you learn how to work with strings, you're effectively also learning how to work with lists, tuples, dicts, sets, and any data structure that *you* create.  Because they're all based on the same types of objects, classes, methods, etc.\n",

    "1. Generally speaking, attributes are names that come after a `.` in Python. Often, they are methods (as we see here), but they can also be data.  Attributes are core to how objects work.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Python has two value storage systems. One is variables, and the other is attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. You can think of attributes as a private dictionary (name-value pairs) that a particular object owns.  It doesn't look like a dict, but it feels sorta kinda like one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods that have `__` (double underscore) at the start and end of their names are called \"magic methods\" or \"dunder methods\", and we generally don't run them ourselves, but rather let Python's internals call them for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__len__` is the special method that the function `len` calls to get the length of an object in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should always call the `len` function on objects in Python, passing the object as an argument.  Don't call magic methods yourself, except in very rare circumstances."
